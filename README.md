# Morbot

The main objective of this project is to design an analysis tool that we can use to apply forensic techniques over different web servers. With this objective, a virtual environment has been generated and the tool has been coded into the Python language.

The detection engine has been encoded within the "Python‚Äù language. The signatures of this engine are in the structured language "XML". The signature set contains the most common intrusion patterns programmed with regular Python expressions.
